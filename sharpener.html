	<p><b>Description</b> <br><br>
		A pencil sharpener (also referred to as pencil pointer or in Ireland as a parer or topper)is a tool for sharpening a pencil's writing point by shaving away its worn surface.<br>   <br> Pencil sharpeners may be operated manually or by an electric motor. It is common for many sharpeners to have a casing around them, which can be removed for emptying the pencil shavings debris into a trash bin.
